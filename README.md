# Analyzing-Daily-Rainfall-Data: Data Cleaning and Summarization

## Overview
This project is a part of the **Practical Data Science with Python** course at RMIT University. The assignment focuses on the initial stages of the data science process, including data cleaning, exploration, and summarization.

## Project Structure
- `assignment1.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for data cleaning and exploration.
- `Data.csv`: The given dataset.
- `cleaned_data.csv`: The cleaned dataset after processing.
- `report.pdf`: A detailed report summarizing the findings and methodologies used.

## Tasks Overview

### 1. Data Preparation
- **Objective**: Load, clean, and process daily rainfall climate data provided by the Australian Government - Bureau of Meteorology.
- **Steps**:
  - Loaded the CSV data file using `pandas`.
  - Identified and corrected issues such as typos, extra whitespaces, and missing values.
  - Saved the cleaned data into `cleaned_data.csv`.

### 2. Data Exploration
- **Objective**: Analyze the cleaned data to derive insights.
- **Explorations**:
  - Analyzed the highest daily rainfall in each month of 2014.
  - Yearly and monthly analysis of data between 2015 and 2017, including visualizations.
  - Compared the top 3 years with the highest and lowest rainfall amounts.
  - Explored rainfall trends in ABC City over the last 10 years.

### 3. Report
- **Objective**: Document the findings and the process.
- **Content**:
  - A brief explanation of the data cleaning process.
  - Justifications for the methods used in data exploration.
  - Visualizations and comparisons to support the findings.
  
## How to Run
1. Ensure you have `Anaconda` installed with the necessary packages (`pandas`, `matplotlib`, etc.).
2. Open `assignment1.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run all cells to load the data, clean it, and perform the analyses.
4. Review the output for data insights and visualizations.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and other libraries as specified in the notebook.
